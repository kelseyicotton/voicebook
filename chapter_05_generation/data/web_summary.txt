Humans have been storing, retrieving, manipulating, and communicating information since the Sumerians in Mesopotamia developed writing in about 3000 BC, [3] but the term information technology in its modern sense first appeared in a 1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review ; authors Harold J. Leavitt and Thomas L. Whisler commented that "the new technology does not yet have a single established name.Their definition consists of three categories: techniques for processing, the application of statistical and mathematical methods to decision-making , and the simulation of higher-order thinking through computer programs.Several products or services within an economy are associated with information technology, including computer hardware , software, electronics, semiconductors, internet, telecom equipment , and e-commerce .Based on the storage and processing technologies employed, it is possible to distinguish four distinct phases of IT development: pre-mechanical (3000 BC – 1450 AD), mechanical (1450–1840), electromechanical (1840–1940), and electronic (1940–present).Comparable geared devices did not emerge in Europe until the 16th century, and it was not until 1645 that the first mechanical calculator capable of performing the four basic arithmetical operations was developed.The development of transistors in the late 1940s at Bell Laboratories allowed a new generation of computers to be designed with greatly reduced power consumption.Although XML data can be stored in normal file systems , it is commonly held in relational databases to take advantage of their "robust implementation verified by years of both theoretical and practical effort".), "Magnetic drum" , Virtual Exhibitions in Informatics , retrieved 21 August 2011 The Manchester Mark 1 , University of Manchester, archived from the original on 21 November 2008, retrieved 24 January 2009 ^ Khurshudov, Andrei (2001), The Essential Guide to Computer Data Storage: From Floppy to DVD , Prentice Hall, ISBN 978-0-130-92739-2 ^ Wang, Shan X.; Taratorin, Aleksandr Markovich (1999), Magnetic Information Storage Technology , Academic Press, ISBN 978-0-12-734570-3 ^ Wu, Suzanne, , USC News , University of Southern California, retrieved 10 September 2013 ^ Hilbert, Martin; López, Priscila (1 April 2011), "The World's Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information" , Science , 332 (6025): 60–65, doi : 10.1126/science.1200970 , PMID 21310967 , retrieved 10 September 2013 "Americas events- Video animation on The World's Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information from 1986 to 2010" .Zuppo, Colrain M., Defining ICT in a Boundaryless World: The Development of a Working Hierarchy (PDF) , International Journal of Managing Information Technology (IJMIT), p. 19, retrieved 13 February 2016 ^ Proctor, K.

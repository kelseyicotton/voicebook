While net neutrality in the United States took a huge blow in early 2018, India has gone the other way. The world's second-most populous country has introduced some of the strictest net neutrality regulations.

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India stated that the rules are designed so "certain types of content are not prioritized over others and that broadband providers will be unable to slow down or block websites at their choosing." This is a big step for a country in which two-thirds of the population still doesn't have access to the internet but where "more and more people begin to use smartphones" to get online.

Enforcing the rules is a high priority, too. Net neutrality is baked into the conditions for an Indian service provider's license. Any "net neutrality violation could cause a provider to lose its license, a uniquely powerful deterrent."

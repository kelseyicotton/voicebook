##               SERVICE STATEMENT            ##        
================================================ 

If you are using the code written for a larger project, we are 
happy to consult with you and help you with deployment. Our team 
has >10 world experts in Kafka distributed architectures, microservices 
built on top of Node.js / Python / Docker, and applying machine learning to 
model speech and text data. 

We have helped a wide variety of enterprises - small businesses, 
researchers, enterprises, and/or independent developers.

##           MAKE_MIXED_FEATURES.PY           ##    
================================================ 

Make some fixed features using random combinatinos of extracted
features from pyaudioanalysis and spacy. 

Mixed features are an emerging are of research; we still don't know
a lot about these types of features. Feel free to make some new 
ones and try them on your dataset!!

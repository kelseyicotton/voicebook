================================================ 

If you are using the code written for a larger project, we are 
happy to consult with you and help you with deployment. Our team 
has >10 world experts in Kafka distributed architectures, microservices 
built on top of Node.js / Python / Docker, and applying machine learning to 
model speech and text data. 

We have helped a wide variety of enterprises - small businesses, 
researchers, enterprises, and/or independent developers. 

If you would like to work with us let us know @ js@neurolex.co.

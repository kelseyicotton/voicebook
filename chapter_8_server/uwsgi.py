##                  UWSGI.PY                  ##    
================================================ 

Start using uWSGI to run a http server/router passing request to WSGI
applications.

Note that uWSGI is used to interface with Nginx servers to run python-
based application code.

Do not use --http when you have a frontend webserver or you are doing
some form of benchmark, use --http-socket. Read the quickstart to understand
why:  https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/WSGIquickstart.html
